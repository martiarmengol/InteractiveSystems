Completed all part 2 in advance and added extra features to compensate for the underperformance of the "Roll-a-ball" exercise:
-Added the visuals section, including the heart and shrinking section (part 2)

-Added the sound effects section and personal choice of music (part 2)

-Added the keeping score effects section (part 2)

-Added the UI Manager (part 2)

-Added game title screens (part 2)

Added "levels", when a certain score (sheep hit) is reached, the sheep spawn rate increases as well as the
shooting rate. *Also limited the possibility of being able to hold down the trigger to keep shooting endlessly
